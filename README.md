# Ni-C_Phase_Diagram_Carbon_Allotropes_FactSage
This repository includes the methodology, thermodynamic data setup, and results of a Ni–C phase diagram study using FactSage. It explores the impact of graphite, diamond, and graphene on eutectic behavior, solubility limits, and phase stability, with applications in CVD graphene and carbon material design.


# 🧪 Ni–C Phase Diagram Modeling with Graphite, Diamond & Graphene

Welcome to this repository, where thermodynamics meets advanced materials science!

This project explores how different carbon allotropes—**graphite**, **diamond**, and **graphene**—alter the melting point, eutectic features, and solubility limits in the **Nickel–Carbon (Ni–C) binary phase diagram** using **FactSage**.

## 📌 Project Summary

This work presents a computational thermodynamic investigation using custom-built private databases in FactSage to simulate and compare the Ni–C phase diagrams for different solid carbon forms. It highlights how carbon structure impacts phase equilibria and informs the design of carbon-based materials like:

- Graphene films (via CVD)
- Diamond synthesis
- Ni-based alloy processing

## 💡 Fun Fact

Did you know? Graphene and diamond are made of the same element—**carbon**—but behave like totally different materials just because of their atomic structure. That’s phase science magic ✨
