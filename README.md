# Ni-C_Phase_Diagram_Carbon_Allotropes_FactSage
This repository includes the methodology, thermodynamic data setup, and results of a Niâ€“C phase diagram study using FactSage. It explores the impact of graphite, diamond, and graphene on eutectic behavior, solubility limits, and phase stability, with applications in CVD graphene and carbon material design.
